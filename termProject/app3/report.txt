App 3
---------------------------------------------------

For this app a circluar sorted doubly linked list
is employed to hold all the students and their 
information. This solution allows for a 
maxAgeGap of O(1) given that was important 
functionality to have.

Algorithmic Complexity:

createDataSet: O(1)

destroyDataSet: O(n)

searchAge: O(n)

searchID: O(n)

insert: O(n)

delete: O(n)

maxAgeGap: O(1)
